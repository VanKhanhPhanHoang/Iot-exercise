MQTT	and AMQP
Power Usage:
MQTT: Designed for low power and limited devices. Lightweight protocol ideal for IoT (e.g. battery-powered sensors).	
AMQP: Heavier protocol designed for reliability and advanced features. Requires more processing and bandwidth. Not ideal for low-power devices.
Security: 
MQTT: Supports TLS/SSL for secure communication. Security depends on broker configuration.	
AMQP: Also supports TLS and more advanced authentication mechanisms (e.g., SASL). Generally considered more secure and enterprise-ready.
Message Persistence	
MQTT: Supports QoS levels 0, 1, and 2, allowing for guaranteed delivery and retained messages if configured.	
AMQP: Advanced message persistence, transactions, acknowledgments, and queuing built-in. More robust in enterprise scenarios.

MQTT and	HTTP/HTTPS
Power Usage
MQTT: Highly efficient. Maintains a long-lived connection with minimal overhead. Ideal for constrained devices.	
HTTP/HTTPS: Stateless and requires frequent reconnections. More overhead and power usage.
Security	
MQTT: Uses TLS for encrypted communication. Less overhead compared to HTTPS.	
HTTP/HTTPS: HTTPS is secure by design using TLS. Widely adopted and well-supported.
Message Persistence	
MQTT: Built-in support for persistent sessions and retained messages. QoS 1 and 2 ensure message delivery if connection drops.	
HTTP/HTTPS: Stateless; message delivery must be managed manually. No built-in persistence if the client disconnects.
