Sensor: DHT22 (Temperature and Humidity Sensor)
What it does:
- Measures temperature and relative humidity in the surrounding environment.
Electronics/Hardware used:
- Contains a capacitive humidity sensor and a thermistor (for temperature), along with a microcontroller for digital signal output.
Analog or Digital:
- Digital – it outputs data in a digital format via a single-wire protocol.
Units and Range:
- Temperature: -40°C to +80°C (±0.5°C accuracy)
- Humidity: 0% to 100% RH (±2–5% accuracy)

Actuator: SG90 Micro Servo Motor
What it does:
- Rotates to a specific angle, often used for controlling movement in devices (e.g., robot arms, sensors, or locks).
Electronics/Hardware used:
- Contains a small DC motor, a set of gears, and a control circuit that receives PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) signals to determine position.
Analog or Digital:
- Digital control (via PWM) – the signal is digital, though the rotation is analog-like in response.
Units and Range:
- Rotation angle: 0° to 180°
- Voltage: Typically 4.8V to 6V
- Torque: ~1.8 kg·cm at 4.8V
