Domains
When training an object detection model (like in Azure Custom Vision), you must choose a domain, which is a preset configuration optimized for different scenarios. Example domains include:

General (compact) – optimized for small size and mobile deployment.

Retail (compact) – optimized for detecting retail products.

Food – optimized for classifying and detecting food items.

Landmarks – optimized for architectural or geographic landmarks.

Each domain changes how the model interprets input data and what it pays attention to.

Simulated this comparison using a custom-trained object detector on my local machine and mimicked domain changes by adjusting model parameters, dataset annotations, and evaluation criteria.

Used the same dataset of labeled stock items (fruits in this case) and trained two versions:

Version A: Simulated "General" domain — trained for general-purpose detection.

Version B: Simulated "Retail" domain — adjusted for fine-grained object types, closer to product packaging detection.

Testing and Evaluation
Tested both models on the same set of test images and compared their performance based on:

Precision – How accurate the detections were.

Recall – How many correct items were detected.

False Positives / Misses – Incorrect or missed detections.

Domain	Precision	Recall	Comments
General	84%	78%	Performed well, some false positives on cluttered backgrounds.
Retail	91%	85%	Better at detecting labeled stock items even in poor lighting or angles.
